OVERVIEW :

UNLOCKED PHONES?

unlocked phone is not associated to a specific phone carrier or and so that you can use with any SIM card from any network carrier in the world. That means:

• You have more models of phones to choose from than what the carriers offer.

THEN WHAT LOCKED PHONES ARE?

Many phones sold by carriers come “locked” to that carrier. A “locked” phone can only be used with that carrier and we cannot change the carrier; it cannot be used with another carrier’s service. (Not counting roaming.)

This lock can usually be removed by entering a special code or numeric password. In some situations, some carriers will supply this code upon request by the customer; not all carriers will do this.
