# RATING-ANALYSIS-OF-AMAZON-UNLOCKED-MOBILE
OVERVIEW :

An unlocked phone is not tied to a specific phone carrier and can be used on any carrier you choose. 
That means:

 • You have more models of phones to choose from than what the carriers offer.

 • When traveling, you can easily use international SIM cards.

 • You can switch carriers without penalty.

 • Since it's unlocked, it usually has a higher resale value.

The caveat is that you might not get every network feature, like Wi-Fi calling or HD voice, and the carrier won't guarantee that the voice or data network will work perfectly on your phone. In other words, you're on your own.

Thus a analysis is made by using amazon-unlocked-phones dataset(more than 400k data entries) to find the top 10 unlocked phones  and accessories.
